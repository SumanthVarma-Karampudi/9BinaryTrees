Binary Trees: full , complete, perfect, balanced , degenerated binary tree

1.Full BT: leaf node has either 0 or 2 children
2.Complete BT: All levels are completely filled except the last level, Children are filled from left to right
3.Perfect BT: All leaf nodes are the same level
4.Balanced BT: height of the tree at max will be log(n) where n is total no.of nodes
5.Degenerate BT(skew tree): Every node has one children in the single direction.
